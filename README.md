## Title: CodTech IT Solutions Internship - Recipe Organizer Web Development Documentation

### Introduction
This documentation outlines the development of a Recipe Organizer web application as part of an internship project for CodTech IT Solutions. The project was undertaken by Cheeti Kavya (Intern ID: ICOD6201) under the guidance of the development team.

### Intern Details
- **Intern Name**: Cheeti Kavya
- **Intern ID**: ICOD6201
- **Company**: CodTech IT Solutions
- **Project**: Recipe Organizer Web Development

### Task Description
The task assigned to Cheeti Kavya was to create a Recipe Organizer web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application should allow users to view a list of recipes and select a recipe to display its details, including ingredients and an image.

### Implementation
#### HTML Structure
The HTML document (`index.html`) defines the structure of the Recipe Organizer web page. It includes:
- A header (`<header>`) for the application title.
- A main section (`<main>`) divided into two sections:
  - Recipe list (`<section id="recipe-list">`) to display a list of recipes.
  - Recipe details (`<section id="recipe-details">`) to display details of the selected recipe.
- A footer (`<footer>`) at the bottom of the page.

#### CSS Styling
The CSS styles (`<style>` block within `index.html`) provide layout and design for the web page. Key styling includes:
- Font settings for text readability (`font-family`, `font-size`).
- Background color and text color settings.
- Flexbox layout (`display: flex`) for the main section.
- Styling for recipe list (`#recipe-list`) and recipe details (`#recipe-details`).
- Responsive design using viewport meta tag (`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`).

#### JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code (`<script>` block in `index.html`) adds dynamic behavior to the web page:
- Populates the recipe list by iterating over a predefined array of recipes.
- Implements `displayRecipeDetails()` function to update the recipe details section when a recipe is clicked.
- Dynamically updates the content of the recipe details section with the selected recipe's name, image, and ingredients.

### Code Explanation
The provided JavaScript code uses event listeners to handle user interactions:
- The `DOMContentLoaded` event listener ensures that the JavaScript code runs after the HTML content is fully loaded.
- The `forEach()` method iterates over the `recipes` array to create list items (`<li>`) dynamically for each recipe in the recipe list (`<ul id="recipes">`).
- An event listener (`li.addEventListener('click', ...`) is added to each recipe list item to trigger the `displayRecipeDetails()` function when clicked.
- The `displayRecipeDetails(recipe)` function updates the HTML content of the recipe details section (`<section id="recipe-details">`) based on the selected recipe's information.

### Rationale Behind the Chosen Approach
- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Using JavaScript to dynamically render recipe list items and details enhances user experience by allowing seamless interaction without page reloads.
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Flexbox layout and viewport settings ensure that the application is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.
- **Simple User Interface**: The application provides a straightforward user interface focused on displaying recipe information clearly and intuitively.

### Conclusion
The Recipe Organizer web application developed by Cheeti Kavya successfully meets the requirements of the internship task. It demonstrates proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development, providing a foundation for building interactive and dynamic web applications. Future enhancements could include additional features such as search functionality, recipe editing, and user authentication to create a comprehensive recipe management tool. Overall, the project showcases practical skills in frontend web development and lays the groundwork for further exploration and improvement in web application development.
